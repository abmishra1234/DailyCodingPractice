/*
Minimum number of jumps

Given an array of N integers arr[] where each element represents 
the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element. 
Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array 
(starting from the first element). If an element is 0, then you cannot move 
through that element.

Note: Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.
